Generate an 8-second cinematic news-style video that transitions naturally from the previous scene into the current one.

Requirements:
- Keep the same main character: a professional Vietnamese female news anchor, early 30s, elegant and confident.
- Outfit: red traditional áo dài with subtle golden patterns.
- Environment: modern TV newsroom, warm soft lighting, neutral background, realistic reflection on studio floor.
- Camera: 35mm lens, eye-level angle, slightly dynamic framing (subtle dolly or zoom).
- Lighting: key + rim setup, balanced highlights, no harsh shadows.
- Motion: smooth, realistic, continuous from previous scene context.
- Style: cinematic realism, 4K resolution, realistic facial motion and lip sync.
- Duration: exactly 8 seconds.

Do not display any on-screen text or captions in the video.
Focus entirely on visuals, lighting, and natural movement.
